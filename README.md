# Node.js-MySQL

Hello, welcome to my CLI application, BAMAZON.

Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL, Javascript, and Node. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

Go ahead and give it a try by selecting on the item_id and stock_quantity of your choice.
